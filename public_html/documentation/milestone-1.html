            <h3>Persona</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Joe Shmoe</li>
                <li>Age: 33</li>
                <li>Work: Recruiter for big tech</li>
                <li>Tech: Uses chrome and a Windows laptop as device of choice as well as has a cellphone</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Joe being a recruiter for big tech knows his way around a computer with a proficient level of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Joe wants to see an example of my work where I sent him the link to. He will use this to see my skills and what I can do as well as any other work I have done for other companies.</p>
            <p>Joe needs someone on his fullstack team at big tech. While he doesn't mind developers that don't have a degree he needs to see some previous work to be sure they can handle job.</p>
            <p>Since Joe receives many applications he needs a website that is both visually appealing and to the point as he needs to get to the other candidates.</p>
