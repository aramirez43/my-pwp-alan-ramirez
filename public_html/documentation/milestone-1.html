            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Joe being a recruiter for big tech knows his way around a computer with a proficient level of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Joe wants to see an example of my work so I sent him my resume with a link to my portfolio. He will use this to see my skills and what I can do as well as any other work I have done for other companies.</p>
            <p>Joe uses chrome as his browser of choice and uses other programs such as digital studio, tidal, and steam for when he wants to game.</p>
            <p>Joe loves learning about new ways to interact with his pc as well as built his own pc at home but it hardly gets any use as he is always busy.</p>

            <h2>Needs and Wants</h2>
            <p>Since Joe receives many applications he needs a website that is both visually appealing and to the point as he needs to get to the other candidates.</p>
            <p>Joe needs a reliable employee that is willing to learn new skills on the job at a fast pace.</p>
            <p>The candidate also needs to work well with a team and be willing to either work remote or in person.</p>
            <p>Joe needs someone on his fullstack team at big tech. While he doesn't mind developers that don't have a degree he needs to see some previous work to be sure they can handle job.</p>
